# HomeLAB - OFFENSE & DEFENSE

During the course of my project ill be taking you through a Cybersecurity HomeLab.That dives into the world of attack and defense.This home lab composes of a windows server with Active Directory,ubuntu desktop ,Postifx Mail Transfer Agent ,Security onion ,wazuh and linux  

**Part 1** - Here we looking at setting up active directory. 

Active Directory (AD) is a system developed by Microsoft that helps organizations manage and organize their computers, users, and other resources in a network. Think of it like a digital phone book that stores important information and makes sure only the right people can access the right things. It's used to log in, control permissions, and keep everything secure and organized—making it a key part of most Windows-based business environments.Essentaily,AD is what we will utalize for enterprise network .

**Part 2 - SettingUp vulnerable Enviroment**

Next, we’ll be setting up intentional vulnerabilities in our enterprise lab environment. While not standard in real-world systems, this is done for learning and testing purposes—to better understand how attacks work and how to defend against them.
We’ll then deploy Wazuh, an open-source SIEM tool used for detecting, preventing, and responding to threats across on-prem, cloud, and containerized environments.

**Part 3 - Provisioning and setting Ubuntu Desktop**

This will be another workstation in our enterprise network, running Ubuntu—a popular Linux distribution based on Debian. Ubuntu is known for its stability, security, and ease of use, making it suitable for a wide range of environments, including cloud computing, servers, desktops, and IoT devices. It’s commonly used in both development and production settings across the tech industry.
