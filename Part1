why are we using Active Directory?
Active Directory is widely used in enterprise environments to streamline and secure network management. It serves multiple purposes:
1. Centralized Resource Management- AD enables administrators to manage users, devices, and permissions from a single location, reducing complexity.
2. Scalability- It can handle environments ranging from small businesses to multinational corporations with millions of objects.
3. Authentication and Authorization- AD provides a robust framework for verifying users and granting access to resources using security protocols like Kerberos and LDAP.
4. Group Policy Management- Administrators can enforce security settings, deploy software, and manage updates across the network using Group Policy Objects (GPOs).
5. Integration with Other Services -Active Directory integrates seamlessly with services like Microsoft Exchange, Azure AD, and other enterprise applications.
