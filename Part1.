# Part 1 - Installing and configuring windwos server 2025,DNS And DHCP.

For the 1st part of the project we need a windows server running that will be handling our enterprise network.WE them dive into the roles and features we will be adding and setting up the whole
Domain controller.
The projects starts with assaigning a local network adpater we will be using for our virtual machines this makes it easy for our vms to have one network implemented and that we can usily the=an having one

why are we using Active Directory?
Active Directory is widely used in enterprise environments to streamline and secure network management. It serves multiple purposes:
1. Centralized Resource Management- AD enables administrators to manage users, devices, and permissions from a single location, reducing complexity.
2. Scalability- It can handle environments ranging from small businesses to multinational corporations with millions of objects.
3. Authentication and Authorization- AD provides a robust framework for verifying users and granting access to resources using security protocols like Kerberos and LDAP.
4. Group Policy Management- Administrators can enforce security settings, deploy software, and manage updates across the network using Group Policy Objects (GPOs).
5. Integration with Other Services -Active Directory integrates seamlessly with services like Microsoft Exchange, Azure AD, and other enterprise applications.

So this Project we start off by setting up our machines network adapter we do this so we allow the easy communication of our machines.
